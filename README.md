# Hydrogeology Demos
Creating demos for the hydrogeology course, EOSC325, using Plotly Dash. This dashboard is hosted [here](https://hydro-thiem-dupuit-forchheimer.herokuapp.com/). The demo is split into two tabs, one for the Thiem equation and the other for the Dupuit-Forchheimer equation.

## Drawdown Equations
The Thiem equation tab is based on the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-tsLFsz-Ncs&list=PLp1lK6n-xb5O8RnVhcfYvqy1kzU_5IfDF&index=11) and its [associated spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1o-HCwUIwFerDWOWrteSQp-d7wEMhuIz8/view). The Dupuit-Forchheimer equation tab is based on the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zVIHbhhR9-M&list=PLp1lK6n-xb5O8RnVhcfYvqy1kzU_5IfDF&index=12) and its [associated spreadsheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/14ctwoJyRe8ex4IC3RjZh2jilDXbMkqTO/view). Both tabs have simple graphs to plot the drawdown equations, with adjustable parameters.
