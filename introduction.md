# Drawdown due to Steady State Radial Flow to a Well
---

This app calculates the drawdown curve for confined (left Tab) or unconfined (
right Tab) acquifers.

It does this by first setting h2=0, the head at the location of r2. Then the
equation in the figure is used to calculate h1 as a function of r1, and using
3 other parameters set using slider bars.

If the curve seems out of scale, use the "Autoscale" button above and right of
the graph (mouse-over icons reveals their titles).

Click and drag within the figure zooms into the graph. Reset using "Reset axes"
or "Autoscale" buttons.

The "Download plot as png" button little camera) lets you saves the graph as an
image.
